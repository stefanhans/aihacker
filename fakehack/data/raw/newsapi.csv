LONDON (AP) — The Latest on response to deadly tower-block fire in London (all times local): 2:55 p.m. British Prime Minister Theresa May says the government is supporting local authorities in London to make sure residents evacuated from four public housing blocks due to fire safety concerns will have somewhere to stay. Over 600 apartments were evacuated overnight after fire inspectors concluded that the buildings, in north London's Camden area, were unsafe because of problematic fire doors, gas pipe insulation, and external cladding similar to that blamed for the rapid spread of a fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower on June 14. Residents say they were given little notice and were forced to seek emergency shelter. May added that the government is working with local authorities across the country to address fire safety fears about apartment towers.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Nevada Republican Dean Heller became the fifth GOP senator to declare his opposition to the party's banner legislation to scuttle much of Barack Obama's health care overhaul on Friday, more than enough to sink the measure and deliver a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump unless some of them can be brought aboard. Echoing the other four, Heller said he opposes the measure "in this form" but does not rule out backing a version that is changed to his liking. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he's willing to alter the measure to attract support, and next week promises plenty of back-room bargaining as he tries pushing a final package through his chamber.
BEIJING (AP) — More than 120 people were buried by a landslide that caused huge rocks and a mass of earth to come crashing into their homes in a mountain village in southwestern China early Saturday, officials said. The landslide, which came from a mountain, engulfed a cluster of 62 homes and a hotel in the village of Xinmo in Mao County at about 6 a.m., the Sichuan provincial government said. Officials said 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of road were buried in the disaster.
WASHINGTON (AP) — To see where Justice Neil Gorsuch might fit on the Supreme Court, watch the company he keeps. Gorsuch has already paired up four times with Justice Clarence Thomas — the court's most conservative member — in separate opinions that dissent from or take issue with the court's majority rulings. While the sample size is small, the results show Gorsuch's commitment to follow the strict text of the law and a willingness to join Thomas in pushing the envelope further than the court's other conservatives.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two weeks into her new life as a full-time Washingtonian, Melania Trump is staying true to her reputation as more homebody than social butterfly. Not that she hasn't been busy fulfilling her duties as first lady and first mom. Job One has been settling in 11-year-old son Barron — the first boy to live in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. more than 50 years ago. Even the small details of every recent Barron sighting have drawn interest: his T-shirt reading "The Expert," his grasp on a popular fidget spinner toy as he exited Air Force One, his pivot to take a picture of the Marine One helicopter as the family returned from a Father's Day weekend retreat at Camp David.
SEATTLE (AP) — Charleena Lyles loved to sing and dance. She adored her four children. She always smiled, even when facing obstacles. Friends and family members say the 30-year-old pregnant woman shot and killed by police this week was so much more than authorities' account of an unstable person who confronted two officers with kitchen knives and had previous run-ins with the law. The Seattle woman was kind and caring, and "if you met her, you would be drawn in," said her older sister, Monika Williams. "I don't care what she was going through or what anybody was trying to bring on her, she would hit it with a smile," Williams said.
BRENTWOOD, N.Y. (AP) — Their senior year began with sadness and horror. Two fellow students at Brentwood High School were beaten to death in the street. The corpses of three more were discovered in secluded spots — all victims of suspected gang violence. But as they prepare to graduate Sunday, two valedictorians and one of the salutatorians at the huge school insist their stories of scholarship, unity and perseverance deserve as much attention as the carnage. All three are children of immigrants and the first in their families to graduate high school.
PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — The death toll from twin blasts in the northwestern town of Parachinar climbed to 55 overnight, bringing the overall death toll from three separate attacks in Pakistan on Friday to 73, with several others in critical condition, officials said. Shahid Khan, a government official in Parachinar, confirmed the toll Saturday, saying residents who had been preparing to celebrate the end of Ramadan were now in mourning. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni extremist group, claimed the twin bombings at a crowded market in the Shiite-dominated town, linking them to sectarian fighting in Syria.
LONDON (AP) — The scope of Britain's fire-safety crisis broadened Saturday as London officials scrambled to evacuate four public housing towers due to concerns about external cladding, fire doors and insulation around gas pipes. Hundreds of residents hastily packed their bags and sought emergency shelter, with many angry and confused about the chaotic situation. Some refused to leave.
PHILADELPHIA (AP) — On the menu, the flavor profiles seemed incongruous: Chinese dumplings, Italian-style roast pork and a Mexican chicken dish featuring an edible weed. But when dinner was served, the guests seated and plates bearing foods of three different cultures shared, it all made sense. The meal was part of "Breaking Bread; Breaking Barriers," a yearlong program that brings people of different backgrounds together for a meal featuring their cultural favorites, bridging differences one plate at a time.
