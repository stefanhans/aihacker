TOPIC: Make News Real Again!

Have you ever become frustrated by your inability to tell if the

content (articles, tweets, facebook posts, etc.) you are reading

on the internet is actually real? With so many voices

contributing to the vast quantity of content available on the

internet, how do we know which sources we should trust, and

which to dismiss?

Your challenge is to build a model which will make it easier and

more efficient to identify what really is fake news and what is

not (+ everything in between). You model should be able to

determine a level of credibility, content authenticity, and limit

the viral spread of fake content, including fake images.
